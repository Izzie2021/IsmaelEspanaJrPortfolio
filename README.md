# Ismael Espana Portfolio
This project makes me create a online developer portfolio that can provide information about me and my software developer progress.  The goal of this project is to create a  web page that can give information about me and make sure it displays a quality online portfolio using best practices for css and html. 

## User Story
> AS AN employer\
> I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples\
> SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
> GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work\
> WHEN I load their portfolio\
> THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work\
> and how to contact them\
> WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation\
> THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section\
> WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work\
> THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications\
> WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application\
> THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others\
> WHEN I click on the images of the applications\
> THEN I am taken to that deployed application\
> WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices\
> THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

To meet the acceptance criteria, I did the following:
-  Uploaded an image with link to view employee's previous work
-  Presented the web page with developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them and their work
-  Added alt attributes to images with previous work
-  Made sure when I click on link to the section about their work it scrolls to correct section
-  When I click previous work image it links to deployed application of previous work
-  Made sure that when I resize the page or view the site will be viewed with a responsive layout on different screen size
